# Billing Cycle Application

Billing Cycle application, developed to manage the money of users and showing the balance about deposit and withdrawal cash :globe_with_meridians: :moneybag:

<strong>Important:</strong> For this project, it was not mandatory use GraphQL, PWA or TypeScript because it is a small project and does not have a lot of data to retrieve or a lot of type/objects to handle between the modules. I used these technologies because I would like to put all together in a same project, showing how they could work together :)
